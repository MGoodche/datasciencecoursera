### 1- Principles of Analytic Graphics.
  1- Show comparisions: 

  - Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis. Evidence is always relative. If you are comparing hypothesis A, there has to be an hypothesis B that you are going to compare to.
  - Always ask "Compared to What?"
  
  2- Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
  
  - What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
  
  3- Show multivariate data: 

  - Multivariate = more than 2 variables. If you just show 2 variables or 3, it's not going to show the real picture of what's happening, If you put a lot of data, then, the final picture will be much richer.
  - The real world is multivariate
  - Need to "escape flatland"
  
  4- Integration of evidence

  - Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
  - Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
  - Don't let the tool drive the analysis
  
  5- Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.

  - A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
  
  5- Content is king

  - Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content
