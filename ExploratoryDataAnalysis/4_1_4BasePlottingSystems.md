### 1. Plotting System
The core plotting and graphics engine in R is encapsulated in the following packages:
- graphics
- grDevices
The core plotting system is called the base graphic system.

The lattice system is implemented using this packages:
- lattice
- grid

### 2. Base graphics
You are essentially creating two dimensional graphics, and you have to do it in a two phase process. The first part initializes the new plot and the second one, add thing to an existing plot. The base graphics have many parameters to set the gaphics as you want.
