### 1. Introduction
The data set comes from the monitoring data from the United States. Link to the data set: https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/airs/airsaqs/detaildata/downloadaqsdata.htm

First question: Are the pollution levels now better than before? Are the levels on average lower in 2012 than they were in 1999?
