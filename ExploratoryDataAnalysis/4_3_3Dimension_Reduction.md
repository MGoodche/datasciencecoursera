## Dimension Reduction
### 1. Introduction
Dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.

### 2. Using SVD for Dimensionality Reduction
SVD, or Singular Value Decomposition, is one of several techniques that can be used to reduce the dimensionality, i.e., the number of columns, of a data set.
