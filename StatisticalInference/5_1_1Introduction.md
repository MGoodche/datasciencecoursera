# 1. Introduction
The definition of stadistical inference is the process of generating conclusions about a population from a noisy sample. With stadistical inference, the goal is to generate new knowledge. 

Example: Consider trying to predict who's going to win an election on election day, given a sample of voters. This means that our sample is a noisy dataset. So we'd like to try to draw all that uncertainly and use that to predict who's gonna win on election day. Or, when a weather person tells you the probability that it rains tomorrow is 70%, they are to use the historical data to predict tomorrow's weather.
