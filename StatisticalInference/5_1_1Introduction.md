# 1. Introduction
The definition of stadistical inference is the process of generating conclusions about a population from a noisy sample. With stadistical inference, the goal is to generate new knowledge. 
So statistical inference involves formulating conclusions using data AND quantifying the uncertainty associated with those conclusions. The  uncertainty could arise from incomplete or bad data.

Example: Consider trying to predict who's going to win an election on election day, given a sample of voters. This means that our sample is a noisy dataset. So we'd like to try to draw all that uncertainly and use that to predict who's gonna win on election day. Or, when a weather person tells you the probability that it rains tomorrow is 70%, they are to use the historical data to predict tomorrow's weather.
