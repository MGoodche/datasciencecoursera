# 2. Probability

### 2.1 Definition

Given a random experiment, a probability measure is a population quatity that summarizes the randomness.

### 2.2 Random Variables

A random variable is a numerical outcome of an experiment. There are two types: discrete or continuous.

-Discrete random variables are ones that you can count. Here, we assign a probability to every value that they can take.
-Continuous random variables can take any value in a continum. Here, we assign probabilities to ranges that they can take.

#### 2.2.1 Probability Mass Functions

This probability is associated with discrete random variables. A probability mass function evaluated at a value corresponds to the probability that a random variabe takes that value. It is a function that takes any value that a discrete random variable can take, and assigns the probability that it that specific value. The basic rules are:

1. It must always be larger than or equal to 0.
2. The sum of the possible values that a random variable can take has to add up to one.

#### 2.2.2 Probability Density Functions

This probability is associated with continuous random variables. The basic rules are:

1. It must be larger than or equal to zero everywhere
2. The total area under it must be one
