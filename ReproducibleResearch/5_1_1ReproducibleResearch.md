# Reproducible Research

#### 1. Introduction

The purpose is to introduce the idea of reproductibility. The focus of Reproducible Research is how communicate data analysis, using code by writing documents that are very dynamic, and by sharing data so other people can reproduce the work.

#### 2. Replication

The goal of th replication is to have independent people to do independent things with different data, different methods and different laboratories and see if you get the same result. Because if the the finding is robust to all these different things the it is more likely to be true and the evidenve is stronger in it's favor.

#### 3. Structure of a Data 

##### 3.1 Steps in a data analysis
- <b>Define the question:</b> Data Science analysis starts with a question, and not every data analysis starts with the very specific or coherent question. The more specific the question is, the less you have to filter stuff.
- <b>Define the ideal data set</b>
- <b>Determine what data you can access</b>
- <b>Obtain the data</b>
- <b>Clean the data</b>
- <b>Exploratory data analysis:</b> Make concrete questions. If we want to build a model to kind of, we need to split the data set and a training set. So the idea is that we are going to use part of the test of the data set to build our model, and then we are going to use another part of the data set which is independent of the first part to actually determine how good our model is to make a prediction. For the exploratory, we look the data, what are the data, what did the data look like, etc. A basic summary in short. Check for missing data. Create exploratory plots. Perform exploratory analyses (e.g. clustering)
- <b>Statistical prediction/modeling</b>
- <b>Interpret results</b> we need to interpret the findings to use appropriate language. It's good to give an explanation just to explain why centain models predict better than other.
- <b>Challenge results</b>: If you don't do it, someone else is going to do it once they see your results.
- <b>Write up results</b>
- <b>Create reproducible code</b>

##### 3.2 Organizing a Data Analysis

1. Data
- Raw data
- Processed data
2. Figures
- Exploratory figures
- Final figures
3. R code
- Raw scripts
- Final scripts
- R Markdown files (optional)
4. Text
- Readme files
- Text of analysis
