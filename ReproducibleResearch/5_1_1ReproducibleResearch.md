# Reproducible Research

#### 1. Introduction

The purpose is to introduce the idea of reproductibility. The focus of Reproducible Research is how communicate data analysis, using code by writing documents that are very dynamic, and by sharing data so other people can reproduce the work.

#### 2. Replication

The goal of th replication is to have independent people to do independent things with different data, different methods and different laboratories and see if you get the same result. Because if the the finding is robust to all these different things the it is more likely to be true and the evidenve is stronger in it's favor.

#### 3. Structure of a Data 

##### 3.1 Steps in a data analysis
- Define the question: Data Science analysis starts with a question, and not every data analysis starts with the very specific or coherent question. The more specific the question is, the less you have to filter stuff.
- Define the ideal data set
- Determine what data you can access
- Obtain the data
- Clean the data
- Exploratory data analysis: Make concrete questions. If we want to build a model to kind of, we need to split the data set and a training set. So the idea is that we are going to use part of the test of the data set to build our model, and then we are going to use another part of the data set which is independent of the first part to actually determine how good our model is to make a prediction.
- Statistical prediction/modeling
- Interpret results
- Challenge results
- Write up results
- Create reproducible code
