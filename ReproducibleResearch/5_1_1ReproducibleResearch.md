# Reproducible Research

#### 1. Introduction

The purpose is to introduce the idea of reproductibility. The focus of Reproducible Research is how communicate data analysis, using code by writing documents that are very dynamic, and by sharing data so other people can reproduce the work.

#### 2. Replication

The goal of th replication is to have independent people to do independent things with different data, different methods and different laboratories and see if you get the same result. Because if the the finding is robust to all these different things the it is more likely to be true and the evidenve is stronger in it's favor.
