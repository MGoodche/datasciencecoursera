# Coding Standards in R

### How to coding Standards in R
Despite the fact that is difficult to get everyone to agree on one set of ideas, these are the basic principles when you write a code in R:

1. Use text editor and save it as a text file (because there are tipical text format, different programs...and everyone will be able to access to the code)

2. Indent your code

3. Limit the width of the code (80 colums)

4. Limit the lenght of the individual functions (because help you in debug and profiling)
